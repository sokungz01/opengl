# 9_assignment_1 — Sort visualizer (OpenGL)

## Overview

This folder contains an OpenGL-based sort visualization assignment. It implements visual demos of several comparison-based sorting algorithms and animates the sorting process so you can see how elements move and get reordered.

## Included algorithms

- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort

## What this demonstrates

- Algorithm behavior and complexity visualized step-by-step.
- Swaps, comparisons, and partition/merge steps shown as animated bars or shapes.

## Files

Placeholders below — replace with actual filenames present in this directory if different:

- `main.cpp` — program entry and UI/event loop
- `shader.vert` / `shader.frag` — simple shaders for rendering bars
- any asset or config files used by the sketches

## Controls

- 1..5 — select algorithm (1 = insertion, 2 = selection, 3 = bubble, 4 = merge, 5 = quick)
